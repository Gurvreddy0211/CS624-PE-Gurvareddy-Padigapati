## Input
Users interact with a text input to enter new todos, a "Submit" button to add them, "Done" and "Delete" buttons to mark todos as completed (bold and green) or remove them, and a tab bar with "All," "Completed," and "Incomplete" options to filter the list, ensuring intuitive task management within a clean, scrollable interface.

## Process
The app leverages useState to manage inputValue, todos, and filter states, with addTodo creating new todos, toggleComplete updating their completion status, deleteTodo removing them, and getFilteredTodos filtering based on the selected tab ("All," "Completed," "Incomplete"), dynamically rendering the list while logging state changes for debugging, ensuring efficient state management and responsiveness.

## Output
The app displays a scrollable todo list with each item showing its text, a "Done" button to toggle completion (bold and green when completed), a "Delete" button to remove it, and a tab bar filtering the list into "All," "Completed," or "Incomplete" views, with console logs tracking state updates for debugging.
