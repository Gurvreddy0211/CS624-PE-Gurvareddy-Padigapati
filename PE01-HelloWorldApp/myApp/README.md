Input - There is no variable user input accepted by the application. React Native's Text elements are used to hardcode all of the visible values—Name, Degree Program, and School. This guarantees a straightforward, static presentation that doesn't require user input or outside data sources.

Process - The main logic of the application is structured within a functional component named HelloWorldApp. This component uses a single View container to hold and layout three Text elements. Styling is handled through the StyleSheet component to ensure each Text has a yellow background, padding, and margin. The View is centered using flex, justifyContent, and alignItems properties.

Output - The output is a mobile screen displaying three lines of text: the user’s name, their degree program, and their school. Each line appears with a yellow background to meet user requirements. The layout is clean, centered, and readable on most screen sizes.
