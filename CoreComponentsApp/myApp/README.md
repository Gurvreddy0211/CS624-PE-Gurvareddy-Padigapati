Input
It allows the user to enter his/her desired MSCS course via a TextInput field. The app icon is displayed via an image located in the./assets folder. The courses are hardcoded as eight core courses, two depth of study courses, and a capstone course retrieved from the official CityU catalog.

Process
The application is designed as a functional component in arrow function syntax. Simple React Native components such as View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet are used to design the UI. The ScrollView displays all the course details on smaller screens. Internal styles set in StyleSheet.create() define the layout and text components for improved visual presentation.

Output
The page displays an MSCS scrollable list of courses with styled headings, top logo image, and dynamically created input of the user as his/her favorite course. The UI is well-organized and mobile-friendly.
